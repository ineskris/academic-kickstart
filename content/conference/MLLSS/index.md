The Machine Learning Summer School (MLSS) is a 12-days event where participants take intensive courses on a variety of topics in machine learning, ranging from optimization and Bayesian inference to deep learning, reinforcement learning and Gaussian processes (see topics). The objective of the MLSS is to give a broad overview of many relevant topics in machine learning and to help training the next generation of machine learning researchers.
