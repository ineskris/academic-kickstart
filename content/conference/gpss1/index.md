The Gaussian Process Summer Schools are a series of schools and workshops aimed at researchers who want to understand and use Gaussian process models, both in theory and practice. The main summer schools are held in Sheffield, UK. But we also have a series of events that take the summer school ‘on tour’ with Gaussian Process Road Shows.
