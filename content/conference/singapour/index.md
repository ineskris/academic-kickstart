Computing in Cardiology (formerly Computers in Cardiology) is an international scientific conference that has been held annually since 1974. CinC provides a forum for scientists and professionals from the fields of medicine, physics, engineering and computer science to discuss their current research in topics pertaining to computing in clinical cardiology and cardiovascular physiology.

I presented a poster "Anomaly Detection Semi-Supervised Framework for Sepsis Treatment" for early detection of Sepsis in response to the <a href="https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/">PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019 </a>.
