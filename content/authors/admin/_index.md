My research interests lie in **uncertainty quantification** for mathematical and computational models. I'm interested in **Bayesian statistics** and **Variational Inference** methods for handling model misspecification particularly in the field of biology and medicine. I am also working on deep learning methods for health data with a particular interest in genetics.

Currently, I am pursuing my PhD at the University of Nottingham affiliated with Microsoft Research Cambridge. My PhD supervisors are <a href="https://rich-d-wilkinson.github.io/aboutme.html">Richard Wilkinson</a> ,  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/edmeeds/">Ted Meeds </a> , <a href="http://www.jeremy-oakley.staff.shef.ac.uk/"> Jeremy Oakley</a>  and <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/mathematics/people/gary.mirams/">Gary Mirams</a> .
