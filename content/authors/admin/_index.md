I am interested in machine learning, with a particular focus on computational statistics, deep learning, and uncertainty quantification in the field of biology, genetics and medicine. 


My doctoral research aim to understand and develop robust statistical inferential methods for handling model misspecification particularly for cardiac electrophysiology modelling. 



Currently, I am pursuing my PhD at the University of Nottingham affiliated with Microsoft Research Cambridge. My PhD supervisors are <a href="https://rich-d-wilkinson.github.io/aboutme.html">Richard Wilkinson</a> ,  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/edmeeds/">Ted Meeds </a> , <a href="http://www.jeremy-oakley.staff.shef.ac.uk/"> Jeremy Oakley</a>  and <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/mathematics/people/gary.mirams/">Gary Mirams</a> .
