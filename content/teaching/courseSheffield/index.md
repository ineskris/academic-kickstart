This unit is largely concerned with practical statistical inference. Modern computational tools for the implementation of the frequentist and likelihood-based approaches to inference are explored, with strong emphasis placed on the use of simulation and Monte Carlo methods. Statistical theory is also developed with an introduction to the Bayesian approach to inference and decision making. Computational methods for practical Bayesian inference will also be covered.
