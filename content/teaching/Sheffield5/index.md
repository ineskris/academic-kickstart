Mathematical Investigation Skills introduces topics which will be useful throughout students' time as undergraduates and beyond. These skills fall into two categories: computer literacy and presentation skills. Various computer packages are introduced in other modules; these share some programming capabilities, and one aim of this module is to develop programming techniques, particularly in Python and R, which will help students to investigate mathematical problems. Students will also meet the typesetting system LaTeX, preparing reports and presentations into mathematical topics. Students will learn how to put together mathematical websites by learning the basics of HTML. Project work forms a large part of the module, with students working in groups on investigative mathematics.
